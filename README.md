## Supabase Backend Setup

This project uses Supabase as the backend for articles, authentication, and data management. Follow these steps to set up your Supabase project:

### 1. Database Schema Setup

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bxusfjvtccvkpwlxupiq
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` into the SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** to execute the schema creation

This will create all necessary tables:

- `categories` - Article categories
- `articles` - Blog articles with content
- `pages` - Static pages
- `contacts` - Contact form submissions
- `subscribers` - Newsletter subscribers
- `comments` - Article comments
- `article_views` - View tracking
- `user_roles` - User role management

### 2. Create Admin User

1. Go to **Authentication** > **Users** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **Add user** and create a user with your email and password
3. After creating the user, go to **SQL Editor** and run this query to make them an admin:

```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role, created_at)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com'),
  'admin',
  NOW()
);
```

Replace `'your-email@example.com'` with the email you used to create the user.

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Open `admin.html` in your browser
2. Try logging in with the admin credentials you created
3. Create a test article to verify everything is working
4. Check the main site (`index.html`) to see if articles load from Supabase

### 4. Row Level Security (RLS)

The schema automatically sets up Row Level Security policies:

- **Public users** can only read published articles
- **Admin users** can create, read, update, and delete all content
- **Contact forms and subscriptions** are publicly writable but only admin readable

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify credentials** in `supabase-config.js` match your project
3. **Ensure schema is applied** by checking tables exist in Supabase dashboard
4. **Check user roles** by running: `SELECT * FROM user_roles;` in SQL Editor

## Customization

### Colors and Branding

The site uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #2c5530; /* Ghana green */
  --secondary-color: #ffd700; /* Ghana gold */
  --accent-color: #e74c3c; /* Red accent */
  --text-dark: #2c3e50;
  --text-light: #7f8c8d;
}
```

### Adding New Categories

1. Update the category options in both `index.html` and `admin.html`
2. Add corresponding icons in the categories section
3. Update the filter functionality in `script.js`

### Social Media Links

Update social media URLs in the footer section of `index.html` and in the admin settings panel.
